Use Case 1 : Generate Country Population Report
Use Case ID: UC1
Use Case Name: Generate Country Population Report
Description:
This use case allows a user to generate a list of all countries in the world, organized by population from largest to smallest. The report helps compare population sizes across different countries.
Primary Actor:
User (Analyst or Researcher)
Stakeholders and Interests:
•	Organization: Wants accurate and up-to-date global population data.

•	If no data is found, the system notifies the user that the report cannot be generated.
Frequency of Use:
Weekly or monthly, depending on reporting needs.
Assumptions:
The data source is reliable and up to date.


Use Case 2 : Generate Top N Populated Cities Report
Use Case ID: UC2
Use Case Name: Generate Top N Populated Cities Report
Description:
This use case allows the user to view the top N most populated cities in the world, continent, region, or specific country. The user specifies the number (N) to customize the report.
Primary Actor:

2.	The user selects “Top N Populated Cities.”
3.	The user enters a value for N and optionally a region or country.
4.	The system retrieves the matching city data.
5.	The system sorts the cities by population and selects the top N.
6.	The system displays or exports the report.
Alternative Flows:
•	If N is not provided or invalid, the system prompts the user to correct it.
•	If no cities match the selection, the system displays a message.
Frequency of Use:
