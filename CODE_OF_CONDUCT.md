## Key Roles
| Role | Name |
|---|---|
| **Product Owner** | Devyon Lozano |
| **Scrum Master** | Alyssa Bowman |
| | Dexter Joseph |

## i. Maintaining a Respectful Environment
- Be respectful, welcoming, and polite.
- Harassment, buillying, or abuse in **any form** will not be tolerated, and engaging in such activity will result in an immediate report to the module delivery team, and removal from the group's communication channels.
- Group members will refrain from swearing or other highly inappropriate behavior.
- Any feedback given regarding code or deliverables must be constructive and directed at the work, rather than the group member.

## ii. Collaboration
- Group communication is to be carried out via Microsoft Teams. Outlook may be used as a secondary means.
- There will be twice-weekly scheduled group meetings in which Scrum tasks will be carried out (Sprint Planning, Planning Poker, Sprint Review, etc.). Additional meetings may be scheduled as required.
- Group members will report their contributions in text-based daily standups throughout the week.
- Failure to attend group meetings and/or carry out assigned tasks may be reasonably explained to the group; however, an extended period of inactivity will result in a report being made to the module delivery team, who will provide guidance on how to move forward.

## iii. Contribution Standards
- Group members must work on their assigned issues in every sprint cycle, which can be found via the Scrumban board on Zube.io.
- Group members must adhere to the gitflow model by creating features branches when tackling tasks and merging into the `develop` branch when a feature is complete.
- Group members must ensure to exclusively merge working code into the `release` and `master` branches.
- Group members must comment their code effectively as to facilitate knowledge sharing.
